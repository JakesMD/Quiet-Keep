# Quiet Keep

A noise activated lighthouse to help kids find their inside voices.

## 🕹️ Usage

- Place the lighthouse high up on a shelf away from direct sound sources.
- When the lighthouse senses that the general noise level is too high, it will beep.
- If the lighthouse is beeping prematurely, turn the trimpot to the left to increase the sensitivity.
- If the lighthouse is not beeping at all, turn the trimpot to the right to decrease the sensitivity.
